# Machine Status Indicator
### For Machines, Tools, Equipment, and Other Things

This is a printable visual status indicator intended to show the current status of shared tools and equipment in a makerspace or hackerspace. It could also be used in other spaces where showing the status of something might be useful: a commercial kitchen, a warehouse, a laboratory, or a school.

It is designed to print in black/white on 8.5x11, but benefits from the addition of color which you can fill in with a color marker or color pencil. Bendable brad fasteners work best to pin everything together. You can make it more durable by laminating it or by adding a little tape around the edges, and use some tape or velcro to attach it to the machine. 

### Instructions
1. For best results, [download machine-status-indicator.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zirafa/machine-status-indicator/master/machine-status-indicator.svg) and open in Inkscape (or Illustrator)
2. Print out on a 8.5x11 sheet of paper
3. Cut out the pieces, insert wheel inside of sleeve, and use a bendable brad fastener to pin everything together.
4. Place on various machines in your makerspace. Rotate the wheel to let others know the current status of the machine.
