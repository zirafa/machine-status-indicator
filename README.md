# Status Indicator Sign
## For Machines, Tools, Equipment, and Other Things

This is a visual device intended to show the current status of shared tools and equipment in a makerspace or hackerspace. It could also be used in other spaces where showing the status of something might be useful: a commercial kitchen, a warehouse, a laboratory, or a school.

It is designed to print in black/white on 8.5x11, but benefits from the addition of color which you can fill in with a color marker or color pencil. You can make it more durable by laminating it or by adding a little tape around the edges, and use some tape or velcro to attach it to the machine. Bendable brad fasteners work best to pin everything together.
